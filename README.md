# Image Processing Examples

This repository contains a set of modular image-processing example projects (C++ / CMake) demonstrating common operations such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, histograms, spatial filtering, segmentation, morphology and DCT. Each example lives in its own folder with source, data and build output produced by CMake.

**Quick summary**
- **Languages:** C++
- **Build system:** CMake (projects can be generated for Visual Studio on Windows)
- **Common dependency:** OpenCV (projects link against OpenCV components)

**Prerequisites**
- **CMake** (>= 3.10 recommended)
- **A C++ toolchain** (Visual Studio on Windows is used in generated builds)
- **OpenCV** built/installed and visible to CMake (projects expect OpenCV and copy DLLs on Windows)

**How to build (Windows / Visual Studio)**
1. Create a build folder (or use the provided `build/` folder inside each example):

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
# or generate a specific generator, e.g.:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
``` 

2. Open the generated solution (`*.sln`) in Visual Studio and build, or build from command line with `cmake --build . --config Release`.

3. Run the produced executable. Some examples include `run.bat` or custom post-build copy steps for OpenCV DLLs.

**Repository layout**

- **01_grayscale/**
    - `CMakeLists.txt` (top-level for this example)
    - `run.bat` (helper to run the built binary on Windows)
    - `build/` (CMake build output, generated)
    - `data/` (example images used by the program)
    - `src/`
        - `CMakeLists.txt` (example-specific cmake)
        - `main.cpp` (entry point: demonstrates grayscale conversion)
        - `Timer.h` (utility header)

- **02_threshold/**
    - `build/` (CMake build output)
    - `data/` (images used by threshold examples)
    - `src/`
        - `CMakeLists.txt`
        - `main.cpp` (thresholding examples)
        - `Timer.h`

- **03_histogram/**
    - `build/`
    - `data/`
    - `src/`
        - `CMakeLists.txt`
        - `Histogram.cpp` / `Histogram.h` (histogram computation and visualization)
        - `PointOperations.cpp` / `PointOperations.h` (pixel-wise ops)
        - `Threshold.cpp` / `Threshold.h`
        - `main.cpp`
        - `Timer.h`

- **04_spatial_filter/**
    - `build/`
    - `data/`
    - `src/`
        - `Filter.cpp` / `Filter.h` (filter kernels and convolution)
        - `imshow_multiple.h` (helper to show multiple images)
        - `main.cpp`
        - `Timer.h`

- **05_segmentation1_template_matching/**
    - `build/`, `data/`, `src/` with `main.cpp`, `Segmentation.cpp`, `Segmentation.h` (template matching)

- **05_segmentation2_hough/**
    - `build/`, `data/`, `src/` with `main.cpp`, `Segmentation.cpp`, `Segmentation.h` (Hough methods)

- **6_Morphology/**
    - `06_morphology_solution/` (solution folder)
        - `build/`, `data/`, `src/` includes `Morphology.cpp` / `Morphology.h`, `main.cpp`, helpers

- **7_DCT/**
    - `07_dct/` and `07_dct_solution/` (source and solution)
        - `src/` contains `Dct.cpp` / `Dct.h`, `main.cpp`

**Notes about build scripts and linking**
- The per-example `src/CMakeLists.txt` files reference OpenCV targets and components. Ensure OpenCV is installed and CMake can find it (e.g., set `OpenCV_DIR` or install OpenCV system-wide).
- On Windows, many CMake files include logic to copy OpenCV DLLs to the executable output folder after build so the binary can run without adjusting PATH.

**Running examples**
- Typical flow inside an example folder:

```powershell
cd 01_grayscale
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
# then run the executable from the generated output folder (or use run.bat if present)
``` 

- Some examples rely on images in the `data/` folder — check each example's `main.cpp` for required filenames.

**Extending / Adding examples**
- Add a new folder `0X_name/` with `src/`, optional `data/`, and a `CMakeLists.txt` that creates an executable and links to OpenCV targets.

**Where to look in the codebase**
- Example program entry points are in `*/src/main.cpp` files.
- Helper utilities are placed alongside examples in `*/src` (e.g., `Timer.h`, `imshow_multiple.h`).
- Build artifacts are placed in the `build/` subfolders (generated by CMake).

If you want, I can also:
- Add a root-level `CMakeLists.txt` to configure all examples in a single superbuild.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or per-example README files describing inputs and expected outputs.
